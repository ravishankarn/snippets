Qendrim, though fairly new with 1–1.5 years of experience, has quickly become a dependable contributor. He picks up new concepts fast, delivers what’s needed, and approaches problems with strong critical thinking. He puts in the effort to test thoroughly and polish his work beyond the MVP. His recent status tracking page demo was quick and well-executed. Grateful to have him in the team!
