# Mono-Repo vs Multi-Repo Decision Guide

## ✅ Your Context
You have:
- A template repo for AWS Lambdas (multi-Lambda support).
- Another template for EKS apps (multi-app support needs customization).
- A new **monorepo** combining all components with shared automation for:
  - API spec generation
  - CI/CD script creation
  - Environment file generation
- Tooling stack: GitHub Actions, Argo CD, Terraform.

Challenges:
- No smart deploys in monorepo based on component changes.
- Duplication and maintenance overhead in multi-repo.
- Monorepo has a **steep learning curve** due to custom scripts.

## ✅ MONOREPO APPROACH

### 🔷 Pros
- **Centralized management**
- **Code sharing** without duplication
- **Unified automation** for spec/env/scripts
- **Consistent versioning**
- **Simpler post-onboarding experience**

### 🔶 Cons
- **Complex deployment logic**
- **Slower CI/CD unless optimized**
- **ArgoCD scaling issues**
- **Higher learning curve**
- **Merge conflicts in shared files**

---

## ✅ MULTI-REPO APPROACH

### 🔷 Pros
- **Service isolation**
- **Smart deployment capabilities**
- **Simpler onboarding**
- **Clean Git history**
- **Parallel team dev possible**

### 🔶 Cons
- **Code duplication**
- **Repo sprawl**
- **Version drift in shared packages**
- **Higher CI/CD maintenance**
- **Governance inconsistencies**

---

## 🔁 MIDDLE GROUND APPROACH

### Options:
- **Hybrid monorepo with modular subfolders**:
  ```
  /infra/
  /libraries/
  /apps/
     /lambda-foo/
     /lambda-bar/
     /eks-app-1/
  ```
- **Domain-based multi-repo split**
- **Shared NPM packages / Git submodules**
- **Reusable GHA workflows**

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| Factor                              | Favors Mono-Repo           | Favors Multi-Repo          |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Deployment granularity needed       | ❌ Complex                  | ✅ Easier                  |
| Code reuse/shared infra             | ✅ Simplified               | ❌ Requires packaging      |
| Developer onboarding complexity     | ❌ High (initially)         | ✅ Lower                   |
| Team independence                   | ❌ Coupled                  | ✅ Decoupled               |
| GitHub/CI/CD pipeline scaling       | ✅ Shared pipelines         | ❌ Needs per-repo setup    |
| Argo CD scalability & app mgmt      | ❌ Custom logic needed      | ✅ Easier with one app/repo|
| Governance and standards enforcement| ✅ Centralized              | ❌ Needs active policing   |
| Tooling and automation investment   | ✅ Reuse possible           | ❌ Duplicates required     |

## ✅ Recommendations

### Choose Monorepo if:
- Heavy reliance on shared scripts/specs.
- Centralized DevOps is prioritized.
- Willing to manage deployment complexity.

### Choose Multi-Repo if:
- Services are independent.
- Fast and isolated deploys are a must.
- Scaling team/service count significantly.

### Go Hybrid if:
- You need a balance.
- Shared utilities live in one repo.
- Teams want autonomy for their services.
