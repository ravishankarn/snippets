Paternity Leave Plan Notification

Hi Ben

I hope this message finds you well. Following up on our recent conversation during Bi-Weekly connect, I wanted to formally share that my wife and I are expecting the arrival of our child on March, 18th. As discussed, I will be taking 4 weeks of paternity leave starting from the delivery date to support my family during this exciting time.

To ensure seamless continuity of work, I will coordinate closely with team to transition responsibilities and provide the necessary handovers before my leave.

I’ll keep you updated as the date approaches and appreciate your understanding and support as I take this time to focus on my growing family. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further details.
